		[C2] -- Valid Tests --
			- Test with multiple of all directives


	------ Server Block directive ------
		[Py] Listen: Interface (host:port) resolution
				- same server_name but different Interface
		[Py] Server_name: resolution
				[C1] - empty server_name & empty host header 
				- default block: take first server if no server_name match
				- wildcard
					- exactmatch | longest| front| back| front > back
		[Py] Default error page
				- Force a 404 error: Status Code and body should match the error page
				- Error with nonexistant error page
		[Py] Client Max Body Size (max body too small)

	------ Location Block directive ------
		[Py] Location block resolution
				- match | not found | exact match
		[Py] Method allowed (GET, POST, DELETE)
				- HeaderField (allowed: x)
		[Py] Root Directory (empty root, root syntax error)
		[Py] Auto Index
		[Py] Default File
		[C1] CGI: executable to test in/output
				- MessageBody
				- StatusCode
				- Environment variables
				- Errors (BAD_GATEWAY, Syntax)
				- CGI timeout
		[Py] upload_store (see Method Execution - POST)
		[Py] return/redirection (GET/POST/DELETE)

+---------------------+
|        Process      |
+---------------------+
	------ Connection Management ------
		[C1] connection: close
				- HTTP 1.0 [connection != keep-alive]
				- invalid [content-length] (see 400 BAD REQUEST)
				- invalid chunked body (see 400 BAD REQUEST)
		[C1] timeout
		[C1] Unsafe Pipeline:
			- Large Post -> GET (all bytes) -> DELETE -> GET (404) on posted file: to check if unsafe method is not executed concurrently
		[C1] connection: keep-alive

	------ HTTP 1.0 ------
		[C1] connection need to be closed unless header [connection = keep-alive]

	------ Settings ------
		- Preset settings to pass all tests with
		[C1] time out
		[C1] BUFFER_SIZE
		[C1] LIMITS
		[C1] Chunked

	------ Method Execution ------
		[Py] GET
				- 200
				- 404 NOT_FOUND
				[???]- 403 FORBIDDEN (unable to set to 'user has no read permission')
		[Py] POST
				- with upload_store (201 CREATED, 204 NO_CONTENT)
				- w/o upload_store >> root (201 CREATED, 204 NO_CONTENT)
				- 403 FORBIDDEN (file, directory)
		[Py] DELETE
				- 204 NO_CONTENT
				- 404 NOT_FOUND
				- 403 FORBIDDEN (file, directory)
	------ Bad Agent ------
		[C1] Infinite header fields

+---------------------+
|       Response      |
+---------------------+
	------ Response Code ------
		[C1] 100 CONTINUE 
		[Py] 201 CREATED (see Method Execution - POST)
				- Location header should be request target
		[Py] 204 NO_CONTENT (see Method Execution - POST/DELETE)
		[Py] 301 MOVED_PERMANENTLY (see ServerBlock-ErrorPage)
		[C1] 3xx REDIRECT
				- Location header-field
				- Response Code (for different redirection types)
				- Retry-After header-field
		[C1] 400 BAD_REQUEST
				- First line
					- Method (case-sensitive) | Target | version (case-sensitive) | Delimeter (space +end) | whitespace not allowed inside each component | URI_TOO_LONG
				- Header
					- [Host]
						- One host
							- wrong port | non-digit after ":"
						- HTTP 1.1 without host field
						- multiple host field
					- [connection != close | keep-alive]
					- [expect != 100-continue] (see status_code)
					- [content-length]
						- value != digit >> close connection
						- present together with [transfer-encoding] >> close connection
					- [content-coding]
						[Py]- empty value respond 415 UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE
						- non-empty value respond 400
					- WS before ":"
					- duplicate header
						- duplicate [content-length] >> close connection
				- Message body
					- incorrect chunked format >> close connection
		[Py] 403 FORBIDDEN (see Method Execution)
		[Py] 404 NOT_FOUND (see Method Execution)
		[Py] 405 METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED (see LocationBlock-MethodAllowed)
				- check headerfield 'Allow'
		[C1] 408 REQUEST_TIMEOUT
		[Py] 413 PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE (see ServerBlock-ClientMaxSize)
		[Py] 415 UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE
		[Py] 417 EXPECTATION_FAILED
		[C1] 431 REQUEST_HEADER_FIELDS_TOO_LARGE
		[Py] 500 INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR (through out whole program)
		[Py] 501 NOT_IMPLEMENTED
				- method other than: GET POST DELETE)
				- Request header "Transfer-Encoding" other than: chunked (close connection)
		[C1] 502 BAD_GATEWAY
		[C1] 504 GATEWAY_TIMEOUT
		[C1] 505 HTTP_VERSION_NOT_SUPPORTED 

	------ Response Header Field ------
		[Py] Date
				- check if date string len = 29
		[Py] Connection
				- "keep-alive": test by default
				- "close":
					- Request header [Transfer-Encoding != chunked] (see Response 501)
					- HTTP 1.1 request header [connection = close]
					[C1] HTTP 1.0 request header [connection != keep-alive] 
		[Py] Location
				- 201 CREATED (see Method Execution - POST)
				- 3xx: location should be effective request uri (check location presence in defaultEvaluator)
		[Py] Retry-After
				- should present in all 3xx response (check presence in defaultEvaluator)
		[Py] Allow (see Location Block - Method allowed & Response Code 405)
		[Py] Content-Length
				- cannot present together with Transfer-Encoding (check in defaultEvaluator)
		[C1] Transfer-Encoding
			- See Unsafe method (validGet)
		[Py] Content-Type
			Check nonexistant extensions and no extension for content-type


************** Question / To-Discuss **************

1. config: server_name "" is not implemented (should add an empty string to server_name vector)
