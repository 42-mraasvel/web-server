TODO

	- Expect 100 testcase, using a request specific flag
	- 3xx redirection testing
	- Tag execution filter: most tag/name into TestCase class (each request has it's testcase version)

	- If there are multiple responses (or more than 1 per request) print out the remaining responses
	- Log invalid responses: print out only a small message (inside of the ResponseValidator)
	- Detached (multithreaded) should be behind a wrapper surrounding the Client

To Discuss:

	- How to handle multiple response requests (1xx responses)

Client class:

	1. Connect to the server
	2. Send requests, and read responses (using poll)
	3. 

	Options:

		- Timeout for no activity
		- Pipelined

		-- Ideas, Not Implemented Yet --
			- Set CONTENT_LENGTH or TRANSFER_ENCODING
				- Have the client determine the content length or transfer encoding, based on the Chunked option and body size
			- Detached mode
				- For this the Client should have a waitUntilFinished() method, which if in detached mode waits for the threads
			- Send expect: 100-continue before sending message body

General:

	- Keep only what is necessary in terms of Utility files
