-- CGI INTEGRATION CHANGES --

Enumeration of status codes: src/src_normal/utility/status_codes.hpp

Webserver::scanFdTable

	- Modified the way update() is called, so that erasing and updating is seperate
	- EraseFd should be called from Webserver only due to loop invariant violation

Response

	- Added update() function to update CgiHandler (removing FDs, killing/waiting for CGI)

AFdInfo + Fds:

	- getName function for printing
	- setToErase function for having a uniform deletion

CgiHandler:

	- CGI resolution based on request
	- Environment settings
	- Pipe setup with sending/reading from/to CGI respectively
	- Executes CGI, sends message-body and reads output, currently the output is simply the response message-body
	- Cleaning up the FDs and CGI process (killing and waiting)
	- Integration with Client/Response mostly finished: you can now send a CGI request and it will be processed

-- STILL LEFT TODO --

	- Set default index (if target-resource is a directory) before checking CGI:
		- Discuss CGI resolution and default index resolution
	- CGI response parsing
	- ERROR checking for CGI timeout, Read/Write error, executionError
	- Script to generate functions/enumerations with status codes from basic text file
	- Sending a response when the CGI is not finished yet (like a chunked response)
