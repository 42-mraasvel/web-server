Levels

	- REGULAR

		- Always printed, regardless of flags

	- ERROR

		- Like regular, always printed but to the error stream
		- I added an [ERROR] prefix to it for now
		- This should be errors that generally shouldn't ever happen (so parsing request errors that happen frequently shouldn't be here)

	- WARNING

		- Currently always printed with a [WARNING] prefix

	- INFO

		- I think it should only be printed with a flag: slightly more information

			- New connection received
			- Request parsed on connection [N]
			- Response sent on connection [N]
			- Request parsing errors, invalid requests

	- DEBUG

		- Most of the information that's usually not really necessary unless you're trying to hunt down bugs
		- Such as configuration content, request content, response content, intermediary results, etc
