TODO:
	Configuration File:
		Syntax (language form: copy nginx) (ABNF?)
		List everything that needs to be present
		Parse it to the config class instance

	Handler:
		- Response:
			- Generic error response generation based on 4xx status code
			- Resonse generation based on method/request if successful
		- Optimization: Concurrently sending response while reading in message-body using Chunked response (Possible?)

	Parser:
		- Chunked message
		- Iterations



	Client:
		Check if request has been fully read, whether or not we need to do more
		Update readEvent to be dynamic

	CGI:
		Configuration file input
		Execution
		Output redirection (piping)
