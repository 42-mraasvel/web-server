# HTTP Web Server

A Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 1.1 web server written in C++ 98, inspired by NginX.

This is a project for Codam Coding College.
It can be used to serve any type of content to clients through the HTTP protocol.
Content such as files, for websites or other purposes.

## Supported Functionalities

The server listens on a socket (IP:Port).

It will accept connections on that socket and process HTTP requests.

- HTTP Methods:

	- GET

		Fetch resources from the origin server.

	- POST

		Upload or update resources on the origin server.

	- DELETE

		Delete resources on the origin server.

- Common Gateway Interface (CGI)

	CGI allows the user to specify an external program to execute specific requests. The web server converts the HTTP request to a CGI request, reads the CGI response and converts it back into an HTTP response, which is returned to the client.

- Configuration Options

	Implemented similarly to NginX's configuration. All directives are explained in detail [here](#configuration-syntax-and-directives): 
	
	TODO: LINK

## Usage

### 1. Writing a configuration file

A configuration file can optionally be given to the web server as argument. See above for syntax and all configuration options.

If not specified, a default configuration is used instead.

### 2. Building and running the webserve

	./run.sh [OPTIONS] [ConfigurationFile]

The web server is now able to accept requests, this can be done through the browser or any other valid HTTP client.

TODO: link to options and describe what the options do, etc

### 3. Sending Requests

A typical HTTP request is done through either a browser, or a client program. You can use either a browser, curl, python, or any other custom implementation.

If you're using the default configuration, you can use the following link:

>http://localhost:8080

### Appendix

The `localhost` specifies the IP address of the server. It can also be an exact IP or a domain name that maps to an IP, such as `127.0.0.1` or `example.com`

The `:8080` portion specifies the port you want to send the request to.

## Configuration Syntax and Directives

Configuration file example:

```
server {
	listen 127.0.0.1:8080;
	listen 8081;
	server_name example.com *.example.com www.example.* "";
	
	error_page 404 /error_pages/404.html;
	client_body_size 100M;

	location / {
		allowed_methods GET POST DELETE;

		root /var/www/html;
		autoindex on;
		index index.html index.php;

		cgi .php /usr/bin/php-cgi;
		cgi .py /usr/bin/python3;

		upload_store /var/www/upload;
	}

	location /outdated {
		return 301 http://example.com:8080;
	}
}
```
- Server Block

	```
	server {
		...
	}
	```

	These contain the options for how the web server should handle the requests.

	The server blocks are resolved using the request interface address, the top-most block is the default server.

	There can be multiple server blocks, each block can listen on multiple IP:PORT pairs.

- Listen Directive
	```
	listen 127.0.0.1:8080;
	```
	Instructs the server to accept requests on this IP:PORT pair, multiple listen directives can be present in the same block.
	```
	listen 8081;
	```
	If an IP is not specified, the server will bind to all interfaces for this port.

- Server Names (optional)
	```
	server_name example.com *.example.com www.example.* "";
	```
	Used to further resolve server block for a request if there are multiple matches using the `Host` header field in the request.

	The wildcard `*` matches any number of characters before or after the given string.

	The empty server_name `""` will match with an empty Host header field. If no server_names are specified, this is the default value.

- Error Pages (optional)
	```
	error_page 404 /error_pages/404.html;
	```

	Specify a custom file to respond to certain error codes. If not specified or the file doesn't exist, the web server's default response is used.

- Client Max Body Size (optional)
	```
	client_body_size 100M;
	```

	Specifies maximum size of a request's payload body. If it exceeds this size, it will be rejected.

	Value syntax:

	```
	Bytes: 10000
	Kilbytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes: 1K 1M 1G
	```

- Location Blocks

	```
	location / {
		...
	}

	location /outdated {
		...
	}

	location = /exact_match/ {
		...
	}
	```

	More specific options for how the web server handles the request further, the request target is used to resolve the location block.

	The most specific match is used, unless the `=` (exact match) option is specified, in which case the request target has to match exactly.

	Examples:

	`/outdated/index.html` matches to `/outdated`

	`/exact_match/` matches to `/exact_match/`

	`/exact_match/index.html` matches to `/` because it's the most specific match

- Allowed Methods (optional)

	```
	allowed_methods GET POST DELETE;
	```

	Specifies the accepted HTTP methods for a particular location, all other methods will be rejected.

- Root Directory (optional)
	```
	root /var/www/html;
	```

	Specifies the directory in which the web server should look for files to serve. The default value is `/var/www/html`

- Auto Index (optional)
	```
	autoindex on;
	autoindex off;
	```

	If enabled and the request target is a directory, and a default file cannot be found, a directory listing is returned.

	Default value: on

- Index (optional)
	```
	index index.html index.php;
	```
	Specifies the default files to search for if the request target is a directory. Stops at the first match.

- CGI (optional)
	```
	cgi .php /usr/bin/php-cgi;
	cgi .py /usr/bin/python3;
	```

	If the request target ends in the given file extension, the executable given will be executed as a CGI program, with the request target's full path as argument.

- Uploading Files (optional)
	```
	upload_store /var/www/upload;
	```

	For POST requests, if an upload_store is specified, that directory will be where the file is stored instead of the server root.

- Redirections (optional)
	```
	return 301 http://example.com:8080;
	```

	If a return directive is specified, the client is redirected to the given address.
