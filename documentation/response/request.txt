--    Request Target (origin-form)  --
--------------------------------------
*1. origin-form = absolute-path [ "?" query ]
	- a request directly to an origin server (other than CONNECT or server-wide OPTIONS)
2. absolute-form = absolute-URI
	- a request to a proxy (other than CONNECT or server-wide OPTIONS)
3. authority-form
	- (only used for) CONNECT requests
4. asterisk-form
	- (only used for) server-wide OPTION requests

------------------------------------------
--    [Host] = uri-host [ ":" port ]    --
------------------------------------------
    - A server MUST respond with a 400 (Bad Request) status code to any HTTP/1.1 request message that lacks a Host header field and to any request message that contains more than one Host header field or a Host header field with an invalid field-value. [RFC7230 page 45]
    - A client MUST send a Host header field in an HTTP/1.1 request even if the request-target is in the absolute-form, since this allows the Host information to be forwarded through ancient HTTP/1.0 proxies that might not have implemented Host.

---------------------------------
--    Effective Request URI    --
---------------------------------
	- For a User Agent, the effective request URI is the target URI.
	- Construction:
		1. If the request target is in absolute-form, the effect request URI is the same as the request target.
		2. Otherwise = scheme + "://" + authority + combined path and query
			- URI scheme:				http | https
			- authority:				request's "Host" header field (non-empty), or else:
										default server_name (if port differs, then ":" + port number is appended).
			- combined path and query:	same as the request-target
	- ??? Recipients of an HTTP/1.0 request that lacks a Host header field might need to use heuristics (e.g., examination of the URI path for something unique to a particular host) in order to guess the effective request URIâ€™s authority component.
	
	- The Origin Server needs to decide whether or not to provide service for this effective request URI.
