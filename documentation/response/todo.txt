v- ResponseHandler instead of response, turn response into a struct
v- Post request without CGI
v- Client::update(): don't execute requests if the FdTable is too full
v- Server::Update() can remove the POLLIN event if there are too many open connections

- Upload: check directory given by configuration for POST requests

- Client::closeConnection(): wait a certain amount of time before closing the connection
    - So that the client can finish reading the response
    - Use timeout to check this

>> to check for Host (400 Bad Request):
    - A server MUST respond with a 400 (Bad Request) status code to any HTTP/1.1 request message that lacks a Host header field and to any request message that contains more than one Host hea
    - return 400 if invalid port number in Host
    - eliminate valid port number (so the host )
>> to mark close connection flag:
    - transfer encoding (see note on request part)
    - When Content-Length is valid, but the sender closes the connection or the recipient times out before complete message_body received, the recipient MUST consider the message to be incomplete and close the connection.
>> An origin server MAY respond with a status code of 415 (Unsupported Media Type) if a representation in the request message has a content coding that is not acceptable.

>> Config:
    - Server Block
        - [error_page] code(*1) uri (i.e. error_page 404 /error/404.html
    - Location Block
        - [optional modifier]
            - only accept "="
        - [return]: return code effective_uri (i.e. return 301 http://localhost:8080/index.html)
