>> to mark close connection flag:
    - transfer encoding (see note on request part)
    - When Content-Length is valid, but the sender closes the connection or the recipient times out before complete message_body received, the recipient MUST consider the message to be incomplete and close the connection.
>> An origin server MAY respond with a status code of 415 (Unsupported Media Type) if a representation in the request message has a content coding that is not acceptable.
