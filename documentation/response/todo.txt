>> to check for Host (400 Bad Request):
    - A server MUST respond with a 400 (Bad Request) status code to any HTTP/1.1 request message that lacks a Host header field and to any request message that contains more than one Host hea
    - return 400 if invalid port number in Host
    - eliminate valid port number (so the host )
>> to mark close connection flag:
    - transfer encoding (see note on request part)
    - When Content-Length is valid, but the sender closes the connection or the recipient times out before complete message_body received, the recipient MUST consider the message to be incomplete and close the connection.
>> An origin server MAY respond with a status code of 415 (Unsupported Media Type) if a representation in the request message has a content coding that is not acceptable.
