>> fill response header
    - Content-type?
    - Date & time?
    - Server name?

>> what if File::read or File::write occurs error half way, how to draw the response?

>> Maarten to change:
    - A server MUST respond with a 400 (Bad Request) status code to any HTTP/1.1 request message that lacks a Host header field and to any request message that contains more than one Host header field or a Host header field with an invalid field-value. [RFC7230 page 45] >> Client handle no Host or invalid, parser handle multiple host

>> to discuss with maarten:
    - 411 LENGTH REQUIRED??? how to check?
    -If a Transfer-Encoding header field is present in a request and the chunked transfer coding is not the final encoding, the message body length cannot be determined reliably; the server MUST respond with the 400 (Bad Request) status code and then close the connection.
