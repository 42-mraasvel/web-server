>> Redirection (3xx)
    - is URL good for Location header?

>> resolve with config file
    - parse resource target %xxx
    - add "=" into location resolution
    - to delete extra in Config files
    - to discuss with team whether do it or not:
        - regular expression for server_name?
        - modifier for location?

>> To discuss:
    - how to improve the update() process? CgiHandler is not doing anything fot evaluateExecutionCompletion()...evaluateExecutionError()
    - implementation of MediaType + how to define charset?
    - if only send a string, no response for bad-request?
    - tear-down process go through
        - should implement close in stage or not?
    - redirection: do we config rewrite? try-files?
    - default server name as "localhost"?
    - content-type: cgi?

>> to check for Host (400 Bad Request):
    - A server MUST respond with a 400 (Bad Request) status code to any HTTP/1.1 request message that lacks a Host header field and to any request message that contains more than one Host hea
    - return 400 if invalid port number in Host
    - eliminate valid port number (so the host )
>> to mark close connection flag:
    - transfer encoding (see note on request part)
    - When Content-Length is valid, but the sender closes the connection or the recipient times out before complete message_body received, the recipient MUST consider the message to be incomplete and close the connection.
>> An origin server MAY respond with a status code of 415 (Unsupported Media Type) if a representation in the request message has a content coding that is not acceptable.
